meteor-bone
================

An application boilerplate using Meteor 0.8.x with Backbone.js. This is being developed
without the use of Meteorite until it is supported on Windows.

In order to properly support the use of npm modules you will need to install meteor-npm
on your development machine (http://meteorhacks.com/complete-npm-integration-for-meteor.html):

npm install -g meteor-npm
