meteor-bone
================
An application boilerplate using Meteor 0.8.x with Backbone.js. This is being developed
without the use of Meteorite until it is supported on Windows.

Based on Justin McCandless' Meteor Backbone Boilerplate (https://github.com/justinmc/meteor-backbone-boilerplate).

In order to properly support the use of npm modules you will need to install meteor-npm
on your development machine (http://meteorhacks.com/complete-npm-integration-for-meteor.html):

```
npm install -g meteor-npm
```
